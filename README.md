## Project 11: BookWorm
This is a project to track books user read. We also learned about @Binding who it can change the @State also and have a code for Size Class Demo using `@Environment(\.horizontalSizeClass) var sizeClass`. If we have View A that contains inside it View B, anything in the environment for View A will also be in the environment for View B (Only in case of NavigationView). We also learned how to add that list edit functionality.
